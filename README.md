This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Learn More

This is a project to integrate AI with workout tracking and nutrition data. The larger idea is that as a user logs workouts and their nutrition data AI will be able to coach the user depending on the goals. It is not a food tracker but a place to add daily macro values. It does, however, track workouts. For example:

- A bodybuilder who is looking to gain muscle size can add nutrition data and log workouts. Then, after AI has enough data, it can then start coaching and guide the user depending on how food has been, workout split, rest days, etc.
- It can be a coach to recommend a strength program and progression as well.

As of this current iteration it is still being developed meaning workouts can be tracked and nutrition can be entered. Adding AI will be coming soon.
